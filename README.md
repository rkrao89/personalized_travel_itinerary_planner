# personalized_travel_itinerary_planner


This solution contains two major components. At first, we will extract the user’s information like Name, location, hobbies, interests and Favourite food etc along with their upcoming travel booking details. With this information we will stitch a user prompt together and pass it to Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic Claude LLM to obtain a personalized travel itinerary that the Customers can use. Below architecture diagram provides us a high level overview of the workflow and the components involved in this architecture.

We will obtain the user ID from the chatbot interface, which will be sent to the Prompt engineering module. User’s information like Name, Location, hobbies, interests and favorite food is extracted from the Redshift database along with their upcoming travel booking details like travel city, check In and check out dates.
